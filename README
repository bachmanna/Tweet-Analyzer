This app deals with the analysis of the tweets. In this
app we have analysed the tweets acoording to the Hashtags
specified by the user and then analysed it's sentiments.
We have used the twitter live streaming API for the live twitter feeds
and filtered the contents according to the hashtags specified by the user.
We have also implemented the hashtags trending in the world and we have
also updated the top 10 hashtags of each country whose trending hashtags
have been displayed on the map. We have used node.js and socket.io in the
backend to retrieve the tweets from the twitter live streaming api.For the 
Front end we have used Google Map API's to display the markers.
